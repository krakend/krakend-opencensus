KrakenD OpenCensus (deprecated)
====

**OpenCensus is no longer maintained**

KrakenD has traditionally offered its telemetry integration through this OpenCensus component, which has provided reliable service for over six years, but now is transitioning to the more modern and robust OpenTelemetry framework.

Due to a change in the industry, the original authors no longer maintain the OpenCensus integration, and all efforts are focused on OpenTelemetry.
